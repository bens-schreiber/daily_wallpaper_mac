# Bing Daily Wallpaper for Mac
This script calls Bing API that the windows app uses, and sets the wallpaper. It also grabs the copyright info, and date. Also provided is a simple bash script that you can use to see the copyright info and date.

## Script Requirements
- `jq` - A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. You can install it with `brew install jq`

## Install and Run
- `chmod +x install.sh`
- `./install.sh`
- `bing-wallpaper` to see the copyright info and date.

This will now run the script every day at 12:00 AM.

### You should also give [Daily Wallpaper HD](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daily-wallpaper-hd/id1507778016?mt=12) a 1 star review for watermarking the wallpapers and putting cash grabs into the app.
